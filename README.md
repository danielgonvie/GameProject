# TA ADVENTURE 👾
*You are a Teacher Assistant at the campus Ironhack. Your role, like the real life, its to avoid all your students and refuse to do some extra work.*

## Getting started ⌨️
You just need a browser and your bare hands to play! > https://danielgonvie.github.io/projectGame/

## Optimal conditions 🖥
This game was created for a screen of 15" in Google Chrome at max screen size.

## Build with 🛠
This project has been done with the html canvas, a bit of CSS and a lot of messy Javascript.

## Special thanks 💖
I'm so glad to have my teammates that i had fun with this week.
A BIG THANKS AND A BEER to my TA Lorena, that endured this calamity for a entire week.
And the entire team of Ironhack for making me feel so motivated and cool with the 💩 I did.
